# AWS-Express-Profile

I have gone through hell trying to get an actual version of my site running on the web. Amazon banned my account because I accidently uploaded a token to github and wont let me start EC2 instances until after they review my account. When I tried to make a new account they gave me a 24 hour wait before they would active it. (please refer to the email chain for screenshots and more details). Thankfully my already existing S3 instance works and I was able to use a MYSQL server from my job to host one of my databases, unfortunately command line access is disabled on my work servers so running a react / node application on them was out of the question. I will do my best to get a real version online as soon as possible with AWS, infact at the time you are reading this It will probably be up. 

To make up for this shortcoming I have provided the following youtube video of me running my application on youtube functioning as it should.

The repository without the .env file can be found on my github at
